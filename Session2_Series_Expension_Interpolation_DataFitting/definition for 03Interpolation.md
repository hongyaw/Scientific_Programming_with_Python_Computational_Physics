###### **Taylor expansion**:

* Taylor expansion (Taylor series) represents a sufficiently smooth function as an infinite polynomial about a point x0
* Approximates a function near a chosen point by a polynomial whose coefficients are determined by the function's derivatives at that point
* Taylor expansion is a polynomial approximation of a function about a point using its derivatives evaluated at that point



###### **Derivatives:**

* How fast one quantity changes when another quantity changes
* if y = f(x), then dy/dx (difference in y/ difference in x)
* How fast y changes when x changes
* 1st derivatives: speed/slope
* 2nd derivatives: how speed changes/curvature(how fast dy/dx changes when x changes)
* 3rd derivatives: how curvature changes (how d2y/dx2 changes when x changes



###### **Why derivatives effect taylor expansion or why**

* Derivatives determine the shape of the Taylor polynomial
* Each derivative controls one aspect of how the polynomial behaves near a point
* Higher derivatives matter because Taylor expansion uses them to copy how a function behaves near a point
* Higher derivatives give a more detailed, zoomed-in description of the function near a point.



###### **Exponential function**: 

* describes growth or decay where the rate of change is proportional to the current value (the bigger it gets, the faster it grows)
* eg. when x increases by 1, the value of y is multiplied by e
* &nbsp;	x= 0, y= 1
* &nbsp;	x= 1, y= 2.718
* &nbsp;	x= 2, y= 7.39
* &nbsp;	x= 3, y= 20.09
